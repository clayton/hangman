h2. Hangman JS

A WIP group of backbone classes tested using QUnit and Sinon as a TDD example.

h3. Three Rules of TDD

# You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
# You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
# You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

h3. Instructions
